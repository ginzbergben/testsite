                <b>Key Points</b>
                <br>
                <br>

                Key takeaways from the HMW statements are:
                <br>
                <br>
                1) Creating a safe space for users to play in without feeling unsettled or like they are in danger
                <br>
                2) Creating an inviting space where users of all skill levels can go and play
                <br>
                3) Encouraging users to be social and fostering a community among players
                <br>
                <br>
                The main concerns of people reviewing my project idea was personal safety. People wanted to ensure that if they were being led towards these social spaces, that their personal safety wouldn’t be jeopardized. The next biggest concern was more about emotional safety. Not everyone carries the same skill level in sports. The biggest question that was raised was how might we accommodate for players that just aren't at the same level. The last key pain point that was commonly brought up was how to create a sense of community. The app would have to make sure that users actively seek out these games and want to play with random users. Similar to how Uber encourages users to get into strangers cars, this app would have to encourage users to play with random strangers. Uber utilizes a rating system with feedback, so perhaps a similar system could be executed.
                <br>
                <br>
                By executing the process of collecting How Might We questions from other members of the class, it allowed me to explore ideas and problems that I might face in my design process. By adding extra view points, it fosters creativity and encourages stronger process to work towards an MVP.

                <p><b>What is the primary goal of your screen-based/application project?</b>
<br><br>
                        The primary goal of my screen-based application is to encourage and drive community and competition in sports by creating a platform for people to organize, run, and compete in pickup basketball games.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Which medium/platform are you focusing on, and why?</b>
                        <br><br>
                        The medium I am planning to focus on is a smartphone, with smart watch compatibility. I find that the combination of the two will be able to provide the user with the most of their experience. The smartphone will act as the hub for the app, allowing players to join games, view leaderboards, and access social aspects. The smart watch will act as more of an in-game interface, showing the users progress in the game through their stats (such as points scored, rebounds, shooting numbers, score, etc) similar to jumbotrons in basketball arenas.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>In which capacities will your screen-based project solve a human problem?</b>
                        <br><br>
                        This app will help solve the problem of creating community when playing sports when you lack the community to begin with. The goal of this app is to encourage and drive a sense of community with sports and I aim to solve the issue of not having enough or any people to play with.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>What keywords (multiple!) best describe the theme of your project?
                        </b><br><br>
                        Some keywords that I would use to describe my project would be:
                        Basketball, Community, Competition, Gamification, Statistics, Active Lifestyle, and Improvement
                        <br><br>
                        <b>What is the intended audience?</b>
                        <br><br>
                        The intended audience are people who are looking to be more active, specifically by playing sports. The audience are people who are looking to play basketball recreationally but are finding obstacles preventing them to do so such as people to play with, and spaces to play.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>In which way will users be encouraged to use your interface over and over again?
                        </b><br><br>
                        By adding a social aspect to the app and creating incentives through gamification, I aim to encourage users to be brought back to the interface to interact with these features. By adding incentives to players, they will be encouraged to stay in the ecosystem of the app.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Based on your research and the How Might We workshop, what is the unique value 
                        proposition of your digital solution?
                        </b><br><br>
                        From the How Might We workshop and my research, the unique value proposition for my product would be that it is a solution to create a wireless network of basketball players to compete with and against.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>How will you evaluate the success of your interface?
                        </b><br><br>
                        Through usability testing, I will evaluate success of my interface by its ease of access for the product’s key features. If users can navigate the interface and get to the functions they want to with ease, then that will be a success. If there are any obstacles for the user, then that means I’d have to go back and think of new ways to display information to the user so they can find what they need.
