            <br>
            <p class="col-12">Looking at a way to incentivize active living in communities</p>

            <p class="col-6 cardi"><b>Idea:</b>
                <br>
                Using wearable tech in social environments to gamify the game of basketball. With this product, a user
                can not only create pickup basketball games, but with the wearable tech in conjunction with smart city
                technology to track their stats in the game. These stats will be tied to a user’s account data, which
                will be displayed on leaderboards. Through incentivization by gamifying the sport, users will strive to
                improve their skills in the game, and in turn encourage them to be more and more active.
                <br>

            <p class="col-12"><b>Project Analysis</b></p>
            <p class="col-lg-3 col-sm-12"><i>If this was your topic, what would the goal of the project be?</i><br><br>The goal of
                this project is to create a social environment within community sports to help users join pickup
                basketball games. A common issue faced is not having someone or enough people to play with, and this
                project will be able to fix that. Another goal is to help users improve their skills by providing
                additional motivation through incentives via gamification, and creating a leaderboard where user’s
                progress will be displayed.</p>
            <p class="col-lg-3 col-sm-12"><i>What do you like about this idea?</i><br><br>I like that this idea will not only
                encourage users to be more active, but it will help increase their social network. Meeting people to
                play sports with in an unorganized setting can be difficult, but with this product it can help ease
                people in.</p>
            <p class="col-lg-3 col-sm-12"><i>What could potentially be your inspirations for this project?</i><br><br>The biggest
                inspiration I have for this project is from never having enough people to play pickup basketball games
                with. Often we would have an odd number of people and be forced to rotate with substitutions, leaving
                one person out. Another inspiration for this project is from the video game series NBA2k, a basketball
                simulation video game that incorporates game design into basketball skills, making users have to improve
                their abilities through an in game currency, providing “economic” incentives.</p>
            <p class="col-lg-3 col-sm-12"><i>How do you imagine the general visual design of the project?</i><br><br>The general
                visual design for this project would follow a very information design based layout, focusing on
                delivering as much information as efficiently as possible to the user (where games are being played,
                average level of players, leaderboards, heat maps).</p>

                    dribbling, to your movements. By combining proven training concepts with real-time analysis,
                    HomeCourt’s
                    unique “train and play” model helps anyone get better at basketball. It’s the fastest way to develop
                    basketball skills in a way that feels less like training and more like a video game.”</i>

                <br>
                HomeCourt is an app developed to improve user’s basketball ability. HomeCourt provides the user with
                basic basketball drills and tracks the user’s ability to complete these drills. The app works by using
                the camera on the users phone to film the user doing premade basketball drills. Using AI technology, the
                camera tracks the user's movements as well as location on the court to determine their ability on the
                court. If they shoot 4 three-point shots but only make one, then the app will record the stats, and
                their three-point percentage for the workout will be 25%. The app saves the heatmap of the user’s
                shooting ability on the court and then provides analytics based on their workout, as well as methods to
                improve their ability. The only technology this app uses is the camera on the user’s phone, no external
                device is used to track data. The app also features “Challenges”, usually with cash prizes, creating an
                economic incentive for users.

                court as well as one on the user playing. The goal of this app is to help the user improve their skills
                in the game of basketball, as well as for coaches to understand their strengths and areas that need

                <br>
                My second idea is creating an anti-social walking wayfinding app. With this product, users can input
                their location, input their destination, and based on location data crowd-sourced by smart city sensors,
                the app will determine the path with the least amount of people.

            <p class="col-lg-3 col-sm-12"><i>If this was your topic, what would the goal of the project be?</i><br><br>The goal of
                this project is to help streamline foot traffic through densely populated areas. Navigating through
                crowds can be difficult, especially when you are already walking with a group. If time is not an issue,
                finding the path of least resistance is beneficial to people who dislike crowds.</p>
            <p class="col-lg-3 col-sm-12"><i>What do you like about this idea?</i><br><br>I like that this idea will help streamline
                foot traffic in major cities like Toronto. When population outgrows the existing infrastructure,
                solutions need to be put in place to reduce overcrowding.</p>
            <p class="col-lg-3 col-sm-12"><i>What could potentially be your inspirations for this project?</i><br><br>My inspiration
                for this idea comes from my own dislike of walking through crowds. I often take the long way to get to
                places if it means dealing with less people.</p>
            <p class="col-lg-3 col-sm-12"><i>How do you imagine the general visual design of the project?</i><br><br>TThe general
                visual design for this project would follow a map based visual style akin to apps like Uber, Google
                Maps, Lyft, Pokemon Go, etc.</p>
