                Key takeaways from Assignment 3:
                <br>
                <br>
                1) Utilizing colour in UI was one of the more difficult aspects of this projects. I wanted to use colour to accent my design and not overpopulate it. Using the right amount of colour was a difficult task but I feel like I used it effectively in my app.
                <br>
                2) Type size was tough because everything is blown up on my screen and not a true indicator of how it would look on a phone. To ensure that my text wasn't too small, I would upload mocks onto InVision and then preview it on my phone.
                <br>
                3) Creating the component library after the app is done is exhausting and definitely the wrong way to go about it. In the future I plan to make my component library as I design my app.
